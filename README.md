This repository contains a collection of small HTML and CSS practice tasks, demonstrating various styling techniques and common web page elements. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of HTML structure and CSS styling.
Here's a brief description of each HTML file included in this repository:
### `task1.html`
A simple HTML page demonstrating basic text styling with CSS. It includes `text-align: justify`, `text-shadow`, and a combination of `font` properties (italic, normal, bold, font-size, font-family) applied to a paragraph.

### `task2.html`
This file showcases the integration of Font Awesome icons and basic CSS for styling headings, paragraphs, and an unordered list. It features an example of a "demo image" heading, FIFA World Cup 2014 news, and a list of stadium destinations and logos.

### `task3.html`
An example of customizing list item markers using `list-style-image`. It demonstrates how to replace the default bullet points with a custom image (assumes `star.png` is present in the same directory) and applies inline styles for `font-size` and `align-items`.

### `task4.html`
Illustrates the difference between `list-style-position: outside` and `list-style-position: inside` for unordered lists. It also shows how to change the `list-style-type` to `circle` for nested list items, providing a clear visual distinction.

### `task5.html`
Presents a styled HTML table with alternating row colors (`odd` class for `background-color: lightgrey`). It demonstrates basic table styling including `border-collapse`, `padding` for `th` and `td`, and `text-align` for table headers.

### `task6(1).html`
Demonstrates a basic horizontal navigation bar implemented using an HTML table. It applies background colors and text colors to different navigation items and shows how to create a simple menu layout.

### `task6(2).html`
Shows a vertical navigation bar implemented using `div` elements. This example utilizes CSS for `background-color`, `font-size`, and `padding` to create a structured vertical menu with clickable links.

### `task7.html`
Another example of a horizontal navigation bar, similar to `task6(1).html`, but with distinct styling. It features a black background for all navigation items, white text, and a prominent orange bottom border for the entire navigation table.
